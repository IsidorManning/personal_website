Sometimes I struggle to connect and manage all of my interests: AI, math, physic, philosophy, entrepreneurship, research, reading, quantum computing, and so on… It can get overwhelming which results in a really cluttered mind. 

I recently had a conversation with a person who advised me to connect topics by breaking them down into their philosophical roots. All disciplines (no matter how technical, abstract, or specialized) is based on underlying assumptions and questions about reality, knowledge, existence, truth, meaning, or logic. If we identify and understand these assumptions and questions we can break all disciplines down into philosophy. Then, we can connect fields using these roots and see the bigger picture.

I will now break down two of my major interests—AI and Math—and see how they fundamentally connect using philosophy. I will now state the questions of both fields, followed by their respective assumptions. Then, we will connect the two.

## AI

### Questions

The field of AI asks ”can we create computer systems that exhibit human intelligence? Can we create computer systems that know, learn, and understand?” So we are asking a fundamental question about human intelligence, understanding, and cognition.

It boils down to a couple of ontological and epistemological questions: 

Can computer systems know and truly understand something? If so, do their understanding exist in the same way as human understanding exist? Can computer systems acquire new knowledge? What does it mean for a computer to “know” something? Can knowledge exist independently of experience? Can knowledge be represented mathematically? What is intelligence—a property, a process, or a pattern? Does understanding exist in an AI, or is it just a human projection? 

### Assumptions

The first assumption we make in AI is that human intelligence is computable. That is, everything about intelligence (learning, emotion, reasoning) can be formalized into algorithms. 

Secondly, we assume that we can mathematically represent the mind. Currently, language model’s elegance comes from their high-dimensional embedding spaces, often called the ”mind” of language models. We use lots of linear algebra to manipulate these spaces and optimization to train these models. We assume that the mathematical theories we use in AI are enough to construct human intelligent computer systems. 

Thirdly, we implicitly assume understanding and intelligence emerges from processing lots of data. We train AI models by feeding it lots of data. 

## Math

### Questions

“Truth” in math is tied to provability within a formal system or theory. A statement is true if it can be deduced from axioms using rules of logic.

An object “exists” if we can define it consistently within a system. 

An interesting ontological question is if mathematical existence is the same as physical existence? Do the prime numbers exist in the same way as a tree exist?

Mathematical knowledge is proof-based. You “know” something if it’s derivable from axioms. Statements are true if you no an prove them!

This, of course, leads to the famous question: Is mathematical knowledge discovered or invented? Both?

Math can also describe infinity, which is a mysterious concept. One of the most fascinating questions is if  infinity is ”real” or if it’s something we have created with our minds?  

Lastly, math explore the question of ”What is causality or change?” Can change be modeled completely? Does determinism in math reflect determinism in reality?

### Assumptions

we assume we can axiomatize. We often don’t prove axioms. Instead, we adopt them. Why these and not others? Could alternative axioms describe different realities? 

Mathematics assumes classical logic. But intuitionistic logic and paraconsistent logic show that even logic can vary. So is logic a human invention or a universal truth?

We assume we can manipulate ideal entities like points, lines, sets, even infinite ones. These don’t exist physically, but we treat them as meaningful objects. Why does that work so well?

Most of physics and AI, for example, is built on the idea that math models reality. But why?

## Connections

The philosophical roots we’ve seen are:

- What is intelligence?
- What is truth?
- What does it mean to “know” something?
- What is existence?

We’ve now broken down technical fields into their ontological and epistemological foundations. 

Isn’t it amazing? For me it definitely feels as if all fields of science are connected. Connected by humanity’s love for discovery and understanding!
