Today I made a post in Reddit to promote Nyfic in a genuine way by talking about one problem I have
experienced when studying. I wrote:


*For the past few months I’ve been deep in self-studying math. id mostly read chapters, watch videos, and feel like I was progressing, turning the page and to me I think I get that dopamine hit of “moving forward.”
I could go weeks without doing exercises and I want to reflect on one thing I have felt: Reading and learning feels more rewarding than doing exercises. At the end of the day, getting through a chapter or a new page "moves you forward" in a clearer way than what solving some problem would do. That's how I feel at least.
I can go weeks without doing any real exercises. it's not because I don't like them. In fact, problem solving is rewarding when I do it. But reading always seems to take over. It's easier to keep going with a chapter than to stop and actually apply what I’ve just read.
That’s where I’m stuck right now, trying to balance these two modes of learning. I’m working on making practice more automatic and integrated into my study flow. Not sure I’ve figured it out yet. Just sharing in case anyone else relates. How do you manage the balance between passive learning and active practice?*

I also attatched an image of Nyfic (the app I am working on and was meant to be promoting in a genuine way)

I posted this in a couple of subreddits and in r/College and r/Productivity I got these two comments:

1. "First of all, nice ad. Second, this app seems like a place for pseudo-intellectuals who want to seem as productive"
1. "I realize from your post history you are just spamming to promote your app"

This is when I realized that **marketing is hard**.

At first I wanted to fight back to these responses. But when working on anything, especially on a business, it is 
important to ask yourself "what if they are right?" to every piece of feedback you get. So that's what I did and now 
I am here to reflect about it.

"What if my marketing efforts, what feels genuine to me, feels like shameful self-promotion to people? What if I am 
thinking about this the wrong way? What if the first impressions people get of me are just that of a spammer constantly promoting
his own stuff?"

## Why is marketing so challenging?


Marketing is hard because you are trying to get people to deeply understand you with, usually, just one post, one call, one email,
one ad, one picture, one demo, one presentation, one conversation, and usually in an extremely limited amount of time. That's difficult to do, and 
while I have no solution at this point, I know it probably takes years to build up that skill of connection and communication. 

Marketing is hard because you need to find a good balance between authenticity and promotion; on the one hand, I want to be authentic, help people, offer value,
comment on other peoples post, and genuinely contributing to a certain community. But on the other hand, at some point I need to promote myself and what I'm doing. At some point 
I need to ask people about my product and be straight-forward with promotion. But how should we balance these two? At what point have I earned enough trust to promote? How do I know other 
people trust me? 

There's ALOOOOT of self-promotion out there. Most subreddits have rules that you can't even have the term "app" in your posts. Most of us don't like when other people promote their stuff. I personally
don't like seeing ads, reading posts that clearly are just fake, AI-generated promotions. I think people have become more and more sensitive to 
even the slightest amount of promotion. We are good at sniffing out marketing, and when people do and point it out (like what happened to me today), it creates a feeling of 
"They caught me trying to trick them" which is uncomfortable to feel when all you tried to do was to "market in a genuine way"

## So what went wrong with my "marketing" today? 

The post I wrote today was argubly bad and I think it highlighted some issues with my current marketing:

- **Introspective:** Looking back at it, it probably didn't make people feel like they were seen. I didn't contribute to these subreddits in a meaningful way. 
- **Me, me, me, me, me:** 90% of the post was just talking about my own struggles. While this can create a personal it doesn't invite people to get to know me and what I hve built.
- **Unclear intentions:** I attached an image of Nyfic without any context. That made the post feel like a stealth ad instead of an invitation to discuss a shared problem.

## Reframing My Marketing Mindset - Implementing the Criticism

Since marketing yourself is about having people getting to know you and your product, I think it is important to play the long game. To build commutiy, to connect with people, to find the right people who 
experience the problems you can solve, creating content that resonates, getting to know your customers as they get to know you, all of these things take time. 

I will also distinguish between two types of goals when marketing, community post vs. app promotion:
- **Post A:** Raw and personal, not any promotion in sight. Purely “this is what I’m struggling with, anyone else?” to build trust and empathy.
- **Post B:** Direct and honest. “Hey, I’m building an app that helps people balance reading and exercises. It’s early but free and I’d love feedback.”
Maybe my problem was trying to merge the two together in a sort of "hidden promotion post," which just made people feel tricked.

I realize we judge everyone instantly and it is absolutely clear now. Some people looked at my profile, saw a link to my product, and instantly got a self-promotion picture. And the people who think that are right, I just hadn't 
realized it. I have literally only made posts that have something to do with my product. There's always some pocture of it, some mentioning of it, some intent behind every post. This is probably one of the root problems and it is something 
I take with me. Marketing is building community. I thought I knew this until I now see I didn't.

Personally, I hate when there's just a picture of an app. I don't want to see features. I want to see faces and real people solving real problems. So that's what I am going to do. I will lead with their problem, earn trust, then offer solutions, not as a pitch, but as help.

Testing new channels is definitely something I will try. I have currently only talked about my product on Reddit, since I have gotten some success on some subreddits like r/GetStudying. Finding the right place where 
your target audience live is perhaps the biggest challenge in marketing. Thus it makes sense to explore more cahnenls: 
- Discord could be cool and fun! I know there are some study servers which encourage promotion of new, helpful, and innovative tools.
- The feedback on posts vary a lot depending on in which subreddit you post in. I made another promotion post in the past and got banned in one subreddit and support in another subrddit telling me the UI 
looked amazing and that they love the product. 
- I will also look into how to create a community around my product, since this is probably the strongest and most valuable thing to have. 

I'm still left with the feeling that it's all to artifical. I am still sitting here strategizing how I can *be genuine, authentic, and trustful*. But am I? I guess that's a whole new post about this topic. 

Hopefully the vision will never be the problem, but the framing of it.
