We dream of exploring the stars. We build stories around it. Epic films. Sci-fi fantasies, grand visions of future civilizations. Wormholes. FTL. Discovering alien worlds. Solving the mysteries of the universe.

But aren’t we already doing just that? Right here. Every day. 

Sometimes I get the same feeling people describe in those stories, not when flying my spaceship, but when living. When I dive into the ocean. Read a new book. When I do some math exercises. When I study a language I don’t yet understand. When listening to music. When eating with my family. When taking a walk with my friends. When feeling. 

It’s the same feeling. The wonder. The expansion. The curiosity. 

The mystery!

The place doesn’t matter. The time doesn’t matter. Maybe all exploration is the same in essence?

Whether it’s a black hole or a piece of paper, the real frontier is our own relationship to curiosity.

Soften yourself. Take away the pressure off of chasing faraway dreams just because they’re far away. Open up that sense of genuineness**.** Calmness. Belonging. Curiosity. Mystery. Perfection. All Exploring.

The universe isn’t just out there. It’s everywhere. It’s where you feel it to be.

And maybe that’s what we all are searching for?
