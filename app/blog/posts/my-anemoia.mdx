I am creating images that doesn’t exist. I feel the warmth and nostalgia for them. Not because they are real. But because I want them to be real. The water. The spaceship. Floating. Slowly laughing. Walking. Exploring. Endless. Free. Anemoia.

Remember when every human disappeared? Remember when none where here? When everything continued to spin and grow? I wasn’t there and I am not supposed to be there, yet I am here. Do you remember the time after our hope? Can you imagine it? Can you feel it?

I know I have felt this. I know that voice. It’s pulsating, screaming, and kissing. Why this connectedness? Why this largeness? Why this?
