The people who got injured without wisdom. The people who fell on a bike without revenue. The bugs that don’t care. The anger that should be recognized. The useless hope of being together. The importance of recognizing you will being forgotten. The ones who got killed. The unknown wars. The disappearance of all soldiers. The failure that came before. The hug that never came nor famed. The playful body just for some temporaries. 

What about remembering that you might get killed in an accident? What about recognizing that bad is necessary? What about recognizing that animals want to eat? What about recognizing that you are a human as well? What showing the things that disgusts you? What about hating? What about truly loving something? What about feeling it slowly moving away? What about feeling everything moving? What about the creators of torture? What about the lost scientists? What about the wasted money? What about when this is over? 

Where are you really? Where are all the other memorials? Where are the remembrances of great bonds and future kings? Where do you really want to be? Where are the ones who think? Where is the bottom? Where are the solutions? Where are the factories that produced love? Where is that car of yours if it would drown? Where would you be if you got traumatized? Where do we talk when you quit? 

All the stars. All the feeding fueled by egoistic chains. All the beauty. All metal. All the betrayal. All the discrimination. All the terror. All the hate. All affection. All jealousy. All minerals that are currently hidden. Are the millions of discoveries we depend upon. All the appreciation a single human receive. All the appreciation no one should see. All innerly bloody. All quickly to be flooded. All that doubt of your appearance. All the tones that you’ve heard. All the factorized food. All the axiomatized structure. All hateful.

When will you see? When will home be where we deem it to be? When will both sides return to coincide? When will the trees lead the way again? When will they finally visualize? When will they finally be reconciling the parts? When will the finally question? When will they cut right through themselves and see that clarity was here all along? When will they stop laughing? When will they stop wishing for luck? When will they stop regurgitating noise? When will the children grow up to realize something else?

Maybe it is easier to just return to who we are?
