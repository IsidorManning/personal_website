For a long time, I approached ambition mostly through goals. Specific 
outcomes needed to be hit. Publish a research paper. Get into a top university. Reach 500 users. Get into this get into that.

But goals can be fragile. You build them in your head, visualize the 
outcome, and start unconsciously tying your self-worth and identtiy to them. 
And when reality doesn’t follow that image, it hurts more than you expect, not 
just because you didn’t win, but because you had imagined the win in the first place.

I’m trying something else.
I’m thinking less about what I need to achieve and more about what direction I need to move in.

I’m not trying to force "success" on a rigid timeline.
I’m trying to commit fully to the path to becoming. More open, more curious.

I'm applying to Y Combinator with Nyfic. Writing that application forced 
me to clarify my vision, understand my product, articulate why it matters. Now, the "goal" could be for me to 
gte accepted into YC. That would be great. But if I get more attatched to the YC image of me, it really 
hurts if I don't get in. Or I could see applying to YC as a *direction* to move in. 
When applying, the biggest shift wasn’t the app itself, but what happened after. 
Suddenly I saw more opportunities around me: local programs, grants, incubators, fellowships. 
I realize tbat if I hadn’t committed to the direction of applying to YC, I never would’ve seen these doors.

Dream. Set goals without setting walls you need to break through.
