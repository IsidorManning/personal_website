Appreciating life comes from the careful act of observing your surroundings. People laughing, hugging, shouting, dancing, crying, fighting, loving, hating, thinking, talking, sharing, listening, walking, running, falling, driving, riding, feeling and people living: No matter what you do, establish a connection between the observance of subtleties in life and the largeness of existence. We all live our own life with its own complexities but are united as a planet, hidden away among the mysteries of the cosmos. Sit down and be calm, but explore the curiosity within. Be here and be there. Observe the subtleties and realize the scale.
