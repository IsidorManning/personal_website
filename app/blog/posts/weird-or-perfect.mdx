Why? Why do trees exist? Why is the universe so large? 
Why is existence a thing? Why do we feel? Why did the universe 
become anything? Why did evolution evolve? Why did I make this mistake? 
Why did we invent anything? Why did we discover the things we discovered?
Why are we alone? Why does anything exist at all? Why should something 
come from nothing? Why not some other creatures? Why wheels? Why silicon? 
Why cities? Why do we experience this in the first place? Whyyyyyyyy? 

Life can feel weird, and it’s not wrong to feel like life is weird. 
We can ask ”Why?” over and over again, until we end up up confessing 
we might not *know* anything. So isn’t **everything weird**? Well, to me 
there’s no definite answers. But there is a beautiful tension between 
weirdness and perfection. 

Maybe this was the only way. Maybe every strange thing is **the only 
possible path to us**. Maybe we observe this reality because it 
supports us? Maybe, given time, life and cars had to emerge.
Cities had to be built. Trees had to grow, and now I have to write this. 
Everything is weird, but maybe it’s also the only path that makes 
sense? Maybe we just don't understand why it should make sense?

So which is it? Is life weird, random, chaotic, or is it necessary and 
perfect?

Maybe **both**? Maybe this kind of perfection *feels* weird. Or maybe 
weirdness is just a sign we’re paying attention? 
I have no answers and I don’t want answers. I do think this thin 
boundary between weirdness and perfection is fascinating.
