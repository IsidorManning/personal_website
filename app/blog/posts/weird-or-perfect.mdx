**All is Either Weird or Perfect**

Why? Why do trees exist? Why is the universe so large? Why is existence a thing? Why do we feel? Why did the universe become anything? Why did evolution evolve? Why did I make this mistake? Why did we invent anything? Why did we discover the things we discovered? Why are we alone? Why does anything exist at all? Why should something come from nothing? Why not some other creatures? Why wheels? Why silicon? Why cities? Why do we experience this in the first place? Why? 

Life can feel weird, and it’s not wrong to feel like life is weird. We can ask ”Why?” over and over again, until we end up up confessing we might not ”know” anything. So isn’t everything weird? Well, to me there’s no definite answers. But there is a beautiful tension between weirdness and perfection. 

Maybe this was the only way. Maybe every strange thing is the only possible path to us. I mean we observe this reality because it supports us. Maybe, given time, life and cars had to emerge. Cities had to be built. Trees had to grow, and I have to write this. Everything is weird, but maybe it’s also the only path that makes sense in hindsight.

So which is it? Is life weird, random, chaotic, or is it necessary and perfect?

Maybe both? Maybe this kind of perfection feels weird. Or maybe weirdness is just a sign we’re paying attention? I have no answers and I don’t want answers. I do thing this thin boundary between weirdness and perfection is fascinating.
