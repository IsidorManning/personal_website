**Why?***

Why do trees exist? Why is the universe so large?  
Why is existence a thing? Why do we feel?  
Why did the universe become *anything*?  
Why did evolution evolve? Why did we invent things?  
Why did we discover what we discovered?  
Why are we alone? Why does anything exist at all?  
Why should something come from nothing?  
Why not some *other* creatures? Why wheels? Why silicon?  
Why cities? Why do we experience this in the first place?

Why? Why? Why?

Life can feel weird, and it’s not wrong to feel like life is weird. 
We can ask ”Why?” over and over again until we realize that we might not *know* anything. 
So isn’t **everything weird**? 

The word *weird* suggests something supernatural.  
And if we can't answer any of our “why” questions,  
then how do we know anything is *natural* in the first place?

To me, there’s no definite answer.  
But there is a beautiful tension between weirdness and perfection.

Maybe this was the only way.  
Maybe every strange thing is **the only possible path to us**.  
Maybe we observe this universe *because* it supports us.  
Given enough time, maybe everything *had* to emerge.  
Trees had to grow. Cities had to be built.  
And now I have to write this.

Everything is weird. But maybe it’s also the only path that makes sense.  
Or maybe it just doesn’t make sense *to us*.  
Maybe we are the ones who can’t understand why it should make sense?

So which is it? Is all weird, random, chaotic, or is it necessary and 
perfect?

Maybe **both**? Maybe this kind of perfection *feels* weird. Or maybe 
weirdness is just a sign we’re paying attention? 
I have no answers and I don’t want answers. I do think this thin 
boundary between weirdness and perfection is fascinating.
